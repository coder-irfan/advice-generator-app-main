# Advice Generator App

This is my solution to the [Advice Generator App challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db) on Frontend Mentor. The app fetches random advice from a public API and displays it with a clean UI. It's responsive and includes a smooth interaction on button click.
